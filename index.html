    about me
  </h2>
  <p>
    I am currently a student in Pittsburgh, PA. My main academic areas are in Linguistics, Chinese Philosophy, 
    and Continental Poststructural Philosophy. In Linguistics, I am currently focuses mainly on pragmatics, discourse analysis, and historical linguistics. 
    Outside of Linguistics, which I see as a more unsullied study, my philosophical endevours
    can draw from a very wide range of sources and cover a very wide range of topics. 
    Thus, my interests and knowledge in philosophy also extends to 
    Legal Philosophy, Jewish Philosophy/Theology/Kabbalah, Schopenhauer, New Confucianism, the Kyoto School, Zen Buddhism, 
    Radical and Postmodern Feminism, Formal Epistemology, and ancient Near Eastern Studies.

    I practice tea ceremony, calligraphy, and I am also a Guzhengist.
