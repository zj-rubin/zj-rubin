    about me
  </h2>
  <p>
    I am currently a student in Pittsburgh, PA. My main academic areas are in Linguistics, Chinese Philosophy, 
    and Continental Poststructural Philosophy. In Linguistics, I am currently focuses mainly on pragmatics, discourse analysis, and historical linguistics. 
    Particularly, I have found interest in deixis, context and common ground, ecolinguistics and eco-critical discourse analysis,
    Classical Chinese, and Jewish languages, and ancient Near-Eastern Languages.  
    Outside of Linguistics, which I see as a more unsullied study, my philosophical endevours
    can draw from a very wide range of sources and cover a very wide range of topics. 
    My primary interests are in Pre-Han Chinese Philosophy, particularly Zhuangzi, the Mingjia philosophers, Xunzi, and Han Fei, 
    and French Poststructuralism, particularly Baudrillard and Deleuze and Guattari. 
    However, my interests and knowledge in philosophy also extend to 
    Legal Philosophy, Jewish Philosophy/Theology/Kabbalah, Schopenhauer, New Confucianism, the Kyoto School, Zen Buddhism, 
    Radical and Postmodern Feminism, Formal Epistemology, and ancient Near Eastern philosophy.
    <br>
    I practice tea ceremony, calligraphy, and I am also a Guzhengist.
